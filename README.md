# myco üçÑ
myco is a WIP pipeline built for phylogenic analysis of the _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ complex (MBTC). It builds upon existing tools such as [clockwork](https://github.com/iqbal-lab-org/clockwork) and (UShER)[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-021-00862-7] to accomplish this task.

## Running myco
The currenly recommended way to run myco is on Terra, a cloud-computing resource which uses Google as its backend. However, it also runs as-is on local machines. See [running_myco.md](./running_myco.md) for instructions.
