# status codes
Status codes represent the status of a given sample after it has completed the pipeline, providing information as to whether it completed the pipeline successfully or was filtered out somewhere along the way. They are visible to the user as a workflow-level output only if you are running myco_raw on a Terra data table, where each instance of the myco_raw workflow recieves one sample.

It's possible too much of it was removed during the decontamination step, or there was never much of it in the first place. Check the size of this sample's input FASTQs and compare that to the size of the FASTQs after the decontamination step and earlyQC. Unfortunately, there isn't really a way to recover this sample unless you want to try running myco_cleaned (which skips decontamination + fastp) on it. |
