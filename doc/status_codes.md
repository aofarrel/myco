# status codes
Status codes represent the status of a given sample after it has completed the pipeline, providing information as to whether it completed the pipeline successfully or was filtered out somewhere along the way. They are visible to the user as a workflow-level output only if you are running myco_raw on a Terra data table, where each instance of the myco_raw workflow recieves one sample.

| VARIANT_CALLING_ADJUDICATION_FAILURE    | The variant calling task failed, and it appears your sample has enough sites for minimap2 but not Cortex                              | yes, if sample can be bigger   | It appears Cortex cannot find any variants to call. It's possible too much of it was removed during the decontamination step, or there was never much of it in the first place. Check the size of this sample's input FASTQs and compare that to the size of the FASTQs after the decontamination step and earlyQC. You *might* be able to recover this sample by running myco_cleaned on raw, not-downsampled FASTQs. |

If your sample started out large enough, there might be enough data left to continue, which you can attempt with AAAAAAA.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| EARLYQC_LOW_MEDIAN_COVERAGE             | TBProfiler detected your sample has a median coverage below AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA                                                        | yes, but the sample is suspect | It's very likely that your sample would be filtered out by later coverage checks even if this check was skipped. If you wish to continue attempting to use it anyway, adjust AAAAAAAAAAA                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| VCF2DIFF_TOO_MANY_LOW_COVERAGE_SITES    | The VCF-to-diff task detected that more than AAAAAAAA percent of your sample had sites below `diff_min_coverage_per_site` coverage    | yes, but the sample is suspect | A diff file can still be generated if `diff_min_coverage_per_site` (default: 10) is set to 0, but note that low coverage sites will not be masked in the resulting diff file.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
